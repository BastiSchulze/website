<h2>Lecturing</h2>
<p>I'm lecturing the following courses within the
<a href="http://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/">Department of Engineering Science.</a></p>

<h3><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}b14">B14 Estimation and Inference</a></h3>
<p> This course provides an introduction to probability theory,
including various properties of distributions and their representation as
 belief networks. It covers maximum likelihood estimation and compares against
 Bayesian inference. The course concludes by introducing decision theory and classification.

<h3><a href="{{ site.baseurl}}c24" >C24 Advanced Probability Theory</a></h3>
<p>
    This course is really less esoteric than its name might suggest, providing a grounded review of probabilistic tools relevant for many applications in data science and predictive analytics. In particular, the course will cover model comparison, the value of information, Gaussian processes, and approximate inference (in the form of Laplace's method and Markov Chain Monte Carlo).

<h3><a href="{{ site.baseurl}}aims_cdt" >
    Data, Estimation and Inference
</a></h3>
<p>
    This course will be taught within the <a href="http://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/">AIMS CDT.</a> A superposition of the courses above, covering an introduction to probability theory, including various properties of distributions and their representation as belief networks.
    It covers maximum likelihood estimation and compares against Bayesian inference, before introducing decision theory and classification.
    The course continues by covering temporal filtering and Gaussian processes, and approximate inference (in the form of Laplace's method and Markov Chain Monte Carlo).

<h2>Tutoring</h2>

<p>I am the senior Engineering Science tutorial fellow at
<a href="http://www.exeter.ox.ac.uk/">Exeter College, Oxford</a>
and external tutor at <a href="http://www.spc.ox.ac.uk/">St Peter's College,
Oxford.</a> I deliver small class (two-three students) teaching of a
wide range of
subjects in Engineering Science, including Information,
Electrical and Electronic Engineering, and Mathematics.

<h2> Graduate Supervision </h2>

<p> Along with my colleagues
<a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~sjrob">Prof Stephen J Roberts</a> and
<a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~fwood/">Dr Frank Wood,</a>
I supervise <a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~parg/doku.php?id=group_members">
DPhil (PhD) students</a> in the
<a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~parg/doku.php">
Machine Learning Research Group.</a>



<h2>Summer Schools and Tutorials</h2>

<p>
    I spoke at the <a href="http://ml.dcs.shef.ac.uk/gpss/gpss14/">Gaussian processes summer school 2014;</a> my slides are up
     <a href="http://ml.dcs.shef.ac.uk/gpss/gpss14/">here.</a>
    I also presented two lectures at the <a href="http://ml.dcs.shef.ac.uk/gpss/gpss13/">
    Gaussian processes summer school 2013,</a> for which <a href="http://ml.dcs.shef.ac.uk/gpss/gpss13/">
    slides</a> are available.
</p>

<p>
    I presented a
<a href="http://panopto.imperial.ac.uk/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=9ca7b787-7310-469d-a47c-deaac7ca313f">
    on Probabilistic Numerics
</a>
(or at least Bayesian quadrature) at Imperial College in February 2015.

<h2>Old Courses</h2>

<h3><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}b16">
B16 Object Oriented Programming</a></h3>

<p> This course provides a brief introduction to
object-oriented design, along with an introduction to C++.
It covers: encapsulation; constructors; implementation and interface;
functions and operators, inheritance and composition; polymorphism;
and templates.
