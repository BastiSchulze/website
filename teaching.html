<h3>Lecturing</h3>
<p id="first">I'm lecturing the following courses within the
<a href="http://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/">Department of Engineering Science.</a></p>
<h4><a href="b14.html">B14 Estimation and Inference</a></h4>

<p id="first"> This course provides an introduction to probability theory,
including various properties of distributions and their representation as
 belief networks. It covers maximum likelihood estimation and compares against
 Bayesian inference. A brief mention is made of sequential inference, namely
 Kalman Filtering, before introducing decision theory and classification.

<h4><a href="b16.html">
B16 Object Oriented Programming</a></h4>

<p id="first"> This course provides a brief introduction to
object-oriented design, along with an introduction to C++.
It covers: encapsulation; constructors; implementation and interface;
functions and operators, inheritance and composition; polymorphism;
and templates.</p>

<h3>Tutoring</h3>

<p id="first">I am the senior Engineering Science tutorial fellow at
<a href="http://www.exeter.ox.ac.uk/">Exeter College, Oxford</a>
and external tutor at <a href="http://www.spc.ox.ac.uk/">St Peter's College,
Oxford.</a> I deliver small class (two-three students) teaching of a
wide range of
subjects in Engineering Science, including Information,
Electrical and Electronic Engineering, and Mathematics.

I supervise <a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~parg/doku.php?id=group_members">
DPhil (PhD) students</a> in the
<a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~parg/doku.php">
Machine Learning Research Group.</a>



<h3>Summer Schools</h3>

<p id="first">I presented two lectures at the <a href="http://ml.dcs.shef.ac.uk/gpss/gpss13/">
Gaussian processes summer school 2013,</a> for which <a href="http://ml.dcs.shef.ac.uk/gpss/gpss13/">
slides</a> are available.
