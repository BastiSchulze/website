Machine intelligence will underpin many of the most profound developments in the 21st century; I work both in developing such algorithms and to consider the broader societal consequences of automation. Economist [Carl Frey](http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/people/453) and I have worked to  predict the societal and economic impact of new technologies, and to understand the differing and changing capabilities of both man and machine.

We're pleased to announce [the Oxford Martin Programme on Economic & Technological Change](http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/research/programmes/tech-change), a new programme established in January 2015 with support from Citi. It has been created to investigate the implications of a rapidly changing technological landscape for economies and societies. The programme will provide an in-depth understanding of how technology is transforming the economy, to help leaders create a successful transition into new ways of working in the 21st Century. 

The programme will provide novel and relevant evidence on:

* How technology is transforming companies and industries;
* Why some places are better at adapting to this transformation;
* Related implications for living standards, inequality and social mobility.
