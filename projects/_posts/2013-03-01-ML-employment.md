Machine Learning is core to many new technologies that threaten employment.

Computers have been an important part of many industries for decades already and have replaced humans in many jobs. A new wave of technological development, driven by Machine Learning, Big Data and Robotics, means that even positions that we once saw as immune to computerisation are now at risk. In particular, machine learning threatens not just routine manual occupations, but also occupations relying on the human faculties of subtle judgement and reasoning. We use Machine Learning techniques themselves to aim to predict the likely employment impact of such technologies, and to propose policy responses.
