[Probabilistic Numerics](http://www.probabilistic-numerics.org) is the study of numerical methods as learning algorithms.

My research interests focus on the design of intelligent systems: algorithms capable of substituting for human time and attention. Such algorithms, like humans, are faced with the task of understanding and acting upon complex, uncertain, data. In practice, understanding requires balancing and averaging over the many possible explanations of the data, and acting requires determining which of many possible actions is truly optimal. These twin challenges are respectively addressed using algorithms for numerical integration (to sum over the space of possible explanations) and numerical optimisation (to find the best of a large set of possible actions). I work to create modular numerical algorithms for both numerical integration and optimisation: algorithms that speak the common language of probability theory. These allow a resultant accuracy to be determined from the varying accuracies of the many constituent numerical algorithms, and for no more costly computation to be allocated to any one of them than is necessary to achieve our overall goals. In this way, our intelligent systems can reason and act under the restrictive time and resource constraints that characterise human-level cognition tasks.
