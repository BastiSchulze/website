	abstract = {Our London Futures insights series focuses on the London economy and what it needs to do to maintain and reinforce its position as a leading global business hub. Our latest report in the programme, Agiletown: the relentless march of technology and London’s response, focuses on the challenges and opportunities that technology presents to London.

The findings indicate that a significant shift is occurring in the labour market. Jobs that do not need to be done in London, or can be fully replaced by technology, will continue to leave the city. However, the job losses will be outweighed by new jobs requiring skills that involve creativity, complex problem-solving and high technical content.

The report brings together research from Oxford Martin School academics Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael A Osborne on the potential impact of automation on jobs in the {UK} and London over the next two decades, and a Deloitte survey of 100 London based organisations, exploring the new jobs that will be created, the skills that will be needed, and the implications for current working practices.},

	abstract = {The visual inspection of crystallization experiments is an important yet time-consuming and subjective step in X-ray crystallography. Previously published studies have focused on automatically classifying crystallization droplets into distinct but ultimately arbitrary experiment outcomes; here, a method is described that instead ranks droplets by their likelihood of containing crystals or microcrystals, thereby prioritizing for visual inspection those images that are most likely to contain useful information. The use of textons is introduced to describe crystallization droplets objectively, allowing them to be scored with the posterior probability of a random forest classifier trained against droplets manually annotated for the presence or absence of crystals or microcrystals. Unlike multi- class classification, this two-class system lends itself naturally to unidirectional ranking, which is most useful for assisting sequential viewing because images can be arranged simply by using these scores: this places droplets with probable crystal- line behaviour early in the viewing order. Using this approach, the top ten wells included at least one human-annotated crystal or microcrystal for 94\% of the plates in a data set of 196 plates imaged with a Minstrel {HT} system. The algorithm is robustly transferable to at least one other imaging system: when the parameters trained from Minstrel {HT} images are applied to a data set imaged by the Rock Imager system, human-annotated crystals ranked in the top ten wells for 90\% of the plates. Because rearranging images is fundamental to the approach, a custom viewer was written to seamlessly support such ranked viewing, along with another important output of the algorithm, namely the shape of the curve of scores, which is itself a useful overview of the behaviour of the plate; additional features with known usefulness were adopted from existing viewers. Evidence is presented that such ranked viewing of images allows faster but more accurate evaluation of drops, in particular for the identification of microcrystals.},

	abstract = {We propose a novel sampling framework for inference in probabilistic models: an active learning approach that converges more quickly (in wall-clock time) than Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) benchmarks. The central challenge in probabilistic inference is numerical integration, to average over ensembles of models or unknown (hyper-)parameters (for example to compute the marginal likelihood or a partition function). {MCMC} has provided approaches to numerical integration that deliver state-of-the-art inference, but can suffer from sample inefficiency and poor convergence diagnostics. Bayesian quadrature techniques offer a model-based solution to such problems, but their uptake has been hindered by prohibitive computation costs. We introduce a warped model for probabilistic integrands (likelihoods) that are known to be non-negative, permitting a cheap active learning scheme to optimally select sample locations. Our algorithm is demonstrated to offer faster convergence (in seconds) relative to simple Monte Carlo and annealed importance sampling on both synthetic and real-world examples.},

	title = {Bayesian Gaussian Processes for Sequential Prediction, Optimisation and Quadrature},
	abstract = {We develop a family of Bayesian algorithms built around Gaussian processes for various problems posed by sensor networks. We firstly introduce an iterative Gaussian process for multi-sensor inference problems, and show how our algorithm is able to cope with data that may be noisy, missing, delayed and/or correlated. Our algorithm can also effectively manage data that features changepoints, such as sensor faults. Extensions to our algorithm allow us to tackle some of the decision problems faced in sensor networks, including observation scheduling. Along these lines, we also propose a general method of global optimisation, Gaussian process global optimisation ({GPGO}), and demonstrate how it may be used for sensor placement.

Our algorithms operate within a complete Bayesian probabilistic framework. As such, we show how the hyperparameters of our system can be marginalised by use of Bayesian quadrature, a principled method of approximate integration. Similar tech niques also allow us to produce full posterior distributions for any hyperparameters of interest, such as the location of changepoints. We frame the selection of the positions of the hyperparameter samples required by Bayesian quadrature as a decision prob lem, with the aim of minimising the uncertainty we possess about the values of the integrals we are approximating. Taking this approach, we have developed sampling for Bayesian quadrature ({SBQ}), a principled competitor to Monte Carlo methods.

We conclude by testing our proposals on real weather sensor networks. We further benchmark {GPGO} on a wide range of canonical test problems, over which it achieves a significant improvement on its competitors. Finally, the efficacy of {SBQ} is demonstrated in the context of both prediction and optimisation.},

Such active data selection is performed with the goal of taking as few observations as necessary in order to maintain a reasonable level of uncertainty about the variables of interest. The presence of faults/changepoints is not always obvious and therefore our algorithm must first detect their occurrence. Having done so, our selection of observations must be appropriately altered. Faults corrupt our observations, reducing their impact; changepoints (abrupt changes in the characteristics of data) may require the transition to an entirely different sampling schedule. Our solution is to employ a Gaussian process formalism that allows for sequential time-series prediction about variables of interest along with a decision theoretic approach to the problem of selecting observations.},

If the function has additional inputs, our covariances can be readily extended to incorporate them—allowing us to consider, for example, functions over both sets and time. These functions can then be optimized using Gaussian process global optimization ({GPGO}). We use the root mean squared error ({RMSE}) of the predictions made using a set of sensors at a particular time as an example of such a function to be optimized; the optimal point specifies the best choice of sensor locations.

In this paper, we propose a new method to infer transit parameters in the presence of systematic noise using Gaussian processes, a technique widely used in the machine learning community for Bayesian regression and classification problems. Our method makes use of auxiliary information about the state of the instrument, but does so in a non-parametric manner, without imposing a specific dependence of the systematics on the instrumental parameters, and naturally allows for the correlated nature of the noise. We give an example application of the method to archival {NICMOS} transmission spectroscopy of the hot Jupiter {HD} 189733, which goes some way towards reconciling the controversy surrounding this dataset in the literature.

	abstract = {The interpretation of {HST} transmission spectroscopy signals has recently
been the subject of much debate, in particular the {NIR} {NICMOS} data of {HD}
189733. At optical wavelengths, a high-altitude haze has been confirmed
with both {STIS} and {ACS}, whereas the presence of molecules has been
claimed with {NICMOS}. However, this detection of molecules has been
disputed based on the ad hoc model used to remove the systematics, the
choice of which changes the interpretation of the transmission signal.
Here, we introduce a powerful new technique, Gaussian Processes ({GPs}),
to model the systematics and simultaneously extract the transmission
spectrum, and demonstrate its application to the {NICMOS} data. {GPs} are a
Bayesian technique widely used in the machine learning community, which
allow us to define a distribution over functions. Rather than impose a
strict, functional form of systematics correction, we marginalise over
potentially infinite numbers of basis functions, effectively inferring
the form of the systematics correction from the data itself. This
results in a more robust interpretation of the signal. We also present
similar analyses of {HST}/{WFC}3 observations of {HD} 189733, which bridge the
gap between the current optical and {NIR} spectrum.},

The approach yields collision-free state tra jectories with adjustably high certainty, while aiming for low social cost. To this end we describe a collision-detection module based on a distribution-independent probabilistic bound. We employ an optimization-based approach to incrementally alter plans until all collisions are avoided with sufficiently high confidence. We consider the case of feedback controlled agents, and alter plans by introducing new setpoints to the agents’ controllers. In the context of a simple stochastic path planning scenario, we compare two alternative strategies for finding such setpoints.
Due to their practical importance, multi-agent collision avoidance and control have been extensively studied across different communities including {AI}, robotics and control. However, these works typically assume linear and discrete dynamic models; by contrast, our work intends to overcome these limitations and to present solutions for continuous state space. While our current experiments were conducted with linear stochastic differential equation ({SDE}) models with state-independent noise (yielding Gaussian processes) our method is also applicable to non-Gaussian cases with state-dependent uncertainties.
To ensure collision avoidance yields low social cost across the entire agent collective, we compare two different coordination mechanisms. Firstly, we consider a simple fixed-priority scheme Erdmann \& Lozano-Perez (1987), and secondly, we modify an auction-based coordination protocol Calliess et al. (2011) to work in our continuous setting. In contrast to pre-existing work in auction-style multi-agent planning (e.g. Tovey et al. (2005); Lagoudakis et al. (2005); Calliess et al. (2011)) and multi-agent collision avoidance (e.g. Kostic et al. (2010); Ayanian \& Kumar (2010)), we avoid a priori discretizations of space and time and present solutions for continuous time and state space.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the question of how much a previously obtained map of a road environment should be trusted for vehicle localisation, during autonomous driving, by assessing the probability that roadworks are being traversed. We compare two formulations of a roadwork prior: one based on Gaussian Process ({GP}) Classification and the other a more conventional Hidden Markov Model ({HMM}) in order to model correlations between nearby parts of a vehicle trajectory. Impor- tantly, our formulation allows this prior to be updated efficiently and repeatedly to gain an ever more accurate model of the environment over time. In the absence of, or in addition to, any in-situ observations, information from dedicated web resources can readily be incorporated into the framework. We evaluate our model using real data from an autonomous car and show that although the {GP} and {HMM} are roughly commensurate in terms of mapping roadworks, the {GP} provides a more powerful representation and lower prediction error. Our method allows us to truly map and anticipate roadworks on urban roads.},

	abstract = {We describe one of the successful products of a research partnership among several academic institutions ({CMU}, Oxford and {UBC}) and a water monitoring company (Aquatic Informatics). Water monitoring sensors are very diverse and remotely distributed. They produce vast quantities of data. The data itself is nonlinear and nonstationary. In addition, unanticipated environmental conditions and limitations in the sensing and communications hardware cause the data to be corrupted by previously uncharacterized nonlinearities, missing observations, spikes and multiple discontinuities. To improve the quality of the data and the monitoring process, this paper introduces an approach that uses Gaussian processes and a general “fault bucket” to capture a priori uncharacterized faults, along with an approximate method for marginalizing the potential faultiness of all observations. This gives rise to an efficient, flexible algorithm for the detection and automatic correction of faults. The probabilistic nature of the method is ideal for reporting uncertainty estimates to human operators. The approach can also be applied to detect patterns, other than faults, which are of great environmental significance. We present a fish sustainability example, where specific patterns in water level need to be detected so that fish don’t get trapped and die in shallow pools.},

More often than not, the critical tuning of {ML} algorithm parameters has relied on domain expertise from experts, along with laborious hand-tuning, brute search or lengthy sampling runs. Against this background, Bayesian optimisation is finding increasing use in automating parameter tuning, making {ML} algorithms accessible even to non-experts. However, the state of the art in Bayesian optimisation is incapable of scaling to the large number of evaluations of algorithm performance required to fit realistic models to complex, big data. We here describe a stochastic, sparse, Bayesian optimisation strategy to solve this problem, using many thousands of noisy evaluations of algorithm performance on subsets of data in order to effectively train algorithms for big data. We provide a comprehensive benchmarking of possible sparsification strategies for Bayesian optimisation, concluding that a Nystrom approximation offers the best scaling and performance for real tasks. Our proposed algorithm demonstrates substantial improvement over the state of the art in tuning the parameters of a Gaussian Process time series prediction task on real, big data.},
