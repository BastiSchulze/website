  abstract =   {We describe a novel approach to quadrature for ratios of
                  probabilistic integrals, such as are used to compute
                  posterior probabilities. This approach offers performance
                  superior to Monte Carlo methods by exploiting a Bayesian
                  quadrature framework. We improve upon previous Bayesian
                  quadrature techniques by explicitly modelling the
                  non-negativity of our integrands, and the correlations that
                  exist between them. It offers most where the integrand is
                  multi-modal and expensive to evaluate. We demonstrate the
                  efficacy of our method on data from the Kepler space
                  telescope.},

  title =  {{Active Learning of Model Evidence Using Bayesian
                  Quadrature.}},
  year =   2012,
  abstract =   { Numerical integration is a key component of many problems in
                  scientific computing, statistical modelling, and machine
                  learning. Bayesian Quadrature is a model-based method for
                  numerical integration which, relative to standard Monte Carlo
                  methods, offers increased sample efficiency and a more robust
                  estimate of the uncertainty in the estimated integral. We
                  propose a novel Bayesian Quadrature approach for numerical
                  integration when the integrand is non-negative, such as the
                  case of computing the marginal likelihood, predictive
                  distribution, or normalising constant of a probabilistic
                  model. Our approach approximately marginalises the quadrature
                  modelâ€™s hyperparameters in closed form, and introduces an ac-
                  tive learning scheme to optimally select function
                  evaluations, as opposed to using Monte Carlo samples. We
                  demonstrate our method on both a number of synthetic
                  benchmarks and a real scientific problem from astronomy.},
