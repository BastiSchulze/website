  abstract = {Technology at Work: The Future of Innovation and Employment, is the latest Citi GPS report from the Oxford Martin School and Citi. It explores trends in automation and points to sluggish job creation caused partly by increasing automation, and argues that secular stagnation in the digital age can only be avoided by a shift towards inclusive growth.

The authors highlight the key challenges, explore some of the new technology brought on by the digital age and set out an agenda for change, calling for long term thinking to mitigate the negative effects of an ever more automated and digital economy.

Technology at Work marks the start of a new programme of research supported by Citi, the Oxford Martin Programme on Technology and Employment.},

  title = {Agiletown : The Relentless March of Technology and {{London}}'s Response},
  abstract = {Our London Futures insights series focuses on the London economy and what it needs to do to maintain and reinforce its position as a leading global business hub. Our latest report in the programme, Agiletown: the relentless march of technology and London's response, focuses on the challenges and opportunities that technology presents to London.

The findings indicate that a significant shift is occurring in the labour market. Jobs that do not need to be done in London, or can be fully replaced by technology, will continue to leave the city. However, the job losses will be outweighed by new jobs requiring skills that involve creativity, complex problem-solving and high technical content.

The report brings together research from Oxford Martin School academics Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael A Osborne on the potential impact of automation on jobs in the UK and London over the next two decades, and a Deloitte survey of 100 London based organisations, exploring the new jobs that will be created, the skills that will be needed, and the implications for current working practices.},

  abstract = {Technology at Work v2.0: The Future Is Not What It Used to Be, produced by the Oxford Martin School and Citi, provides in-depth analysis of the vulnerabilities of countries and cities to job automation, explores what automation will mean for traditional models of economic growth, and considers how governments can prepare for the potentially disruptive impacts of job automation on society.

It builds on 2013 research by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne which found that 47 per cent of US jobs were at risk of automation over the next two decades, and on the first Technology at Work Citi GPS report, published in 2015. 

As well as collaborating on the Citi GPS series of reports, the School has partnered with Citi to create a new programme of research, the Oxford Martin Programme on Technology and Employment, to investigate the implications of a rapidly changing technological landscape for economies and societies.},
