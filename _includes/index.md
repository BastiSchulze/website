## Research Expertise

My goal is to develop machine intelligence in sympathy with societal needs. Within machine learning, I have particular expertise in Gaussian processes, active learning, Bayesian optimisation and Bayesian quadrature, and I am a co-founder of the emerging field of [probabilistic numerics.](http://probabilistic-numerics.org) 
                                                                                                     
My work in non-parametric data analytics has been successfully applied in diverse and challenging contexts. These contexts range from astrostatistics, where my probabilistic algorithms have aided the detection of planets in distant solar systems, to zoology, where my work has helped to clarify how pigeons are able to navigate such extraordinary distances. 

More details are available in my [publications.]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications_code/ )

## Impact on Industry and Policy

My career has been shaped by extensive engagement with industry, both in research and consultancy arrangements. Most recently, I have addressed the broader societal consequences of machine learning and robotics. In particular, I have worked to analyse how intelligent algorithms might soon substitute for human workers, and to predict the resulting impact on employment. This latter work has enjoyed broad and sustained media coverage (featured in <i>BBC Newsnight, the Economist, the Financial Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Independent, the Guardian</i> and <i>the New York Times</i>) and has substantial policy implications related to the future of employment.
