Michael A Osborne (DPhil Oxon) works to develop machine intelligence in sympathy with societal needs. His work in Machine Learning has been successfully applied in diverse contexts, from aiding the detection of planets in distant solar systems to enabling self-driving cars to determine when their maps may have changed due to roadworks. Dr Osborne also has deep interests in the broader societal consequences of machine learning and robotics, and has analysed how intelligent algorithms might soon substitute for human workers.

Dr Osborne is the Dyson Associate Professor in Machine Learning, a co-director of the Oxford Martin programme on Technology and Employment, an Official Fellow of Exeter College, and a co-director of the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Autonomous Intelligent Machines and Systems, all at the University of Oxford.
