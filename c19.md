title: Machine Learning: Inference
tags: teaching
---
Machine learning is a rapidly developing field that lies at the intersection of statistics and computer science.
Its growth can be partially attributed to the vast quantities of data (known as ``big data'') that are now routinely being captured in science and industry.
Machine learning aims to find means of taking decisions upon data that are both computationally tractable and statistically principled.
This course will briefly introduce core concepts in machine learning: supervised vs unsupervised learning; nearest neighbour methods; the challenge of generalisation; and approximate inference (in the form of Laplace's method and variational methods).
The course is taught by Michael A Osborne, incorporating material prepared by [Andrew Zissernan.](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~az/)
