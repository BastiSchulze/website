            Abstract below.
            <blockquote>

                We propose an active learning method for discovering low-
                dimensional structure in high-dimensional Gaussian process (GP)
                tasks. Such problems are increasingly frequent and important,
                but have hitherto presented severe practical difficulties. We
                further introduce a novel technique for approximately
                marginalizing GP hyperparameters, yielding marginal predictions
                robust to hyperparameter mis-specification. Our method offers
                an efficient means of performing GP regression, quadrature, or
                Bayesian optimization in high-dimensional spaces.
