<h2>Profile</h2>
<p>
I'm an Associate Professor in Machine Learning, Official Fellow of <a
href="http://www.exeter.ox.ac.uk">Exeter College</a>  and Faculty Member of
the <a href="http://www.oxford-man.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford-Man Institute of
Quantitative Finance,</a> all at the <a
href="http://www.ox.ac.uk">University of Oxford.</a> I co-lead the <a
href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~parg">Machine Learning Research Group,</a> a
sub-group of the <a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/">Robotics Research
Group</a> in the <a href="http://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/">Department of Engineering
Science.</a> </p>

<p>
  I blog at <a href="http://scriptogr.am/mosb">scriptogr.am/mosb</a>

<h2>Research Expertise</h2>
<p> I design
intelligent algorithms capable of making sense of complex big data. Building
such algorithms requires the use of techniques from Machine Learning and
Computational Statistics; I work to create modular numerical algorithms that
speak the common language of probability theory. My work in non-parametric
data analytics has been successfully applied in diverse and challenging
contexts. These contexts range from astrostatistics, where my probabilistic
algorithms have aided the detection of planets in distant solar systems, to
zoology, where my work has helped to clarify how pigeons are able to navigate
such extraordinary distances.</p>
<p>I have particular expertise in active
learning, Gaussian processes, changepoint detection, Bayesian optimisation and
Bayesian quadrature. More details are available in my <a
href="publications.html">publications.</a></p>

<h2>Impact on Industry and Policy</h2>
<p>
My career has been shaped by extensive engagement with industry, both in
research and consultancy arrangements. My DPhil work on sensor networks had
significant influence on the EPSRC/Industry research project <a
href="http://www.aladdinproject.org">ALADDIN,</a> winner of the <i> Engineer
Award Aerospace and Defence 2009</i>. My work on fault detection and big data
analytics has been demonstrated within a variety of industrial contexts. Most
recently, I have addressed key societal challenges, analysing how intelligent
algorithms might soon substitute for human workers, and predicting the
resulting impact on employment. This latter work has enjoyed broad media
coverage (featured in <i>The Economist, the Financial Times, Forbes, The
Independent, WGBH Radio</i> and the <i>BBC World Service</i>) and has
substantial policy implications related to the future of
employment.
