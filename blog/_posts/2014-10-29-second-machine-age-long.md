Loweâ€™s Introduces Robotic Shopping Assistants at Orchard Supply Hardware Store in California


In fact, as far back as 1589, William Lee, the inventor of the stocking frame knitting machine, had his application for patent protection turned down by Queen Elizabeth the 1st, claiming that the machine "would assuredly bring (her subjects) to ruin by depriving them of employment, thus making them beggars." Of course, these fears have proved historically unfounded




"Where do you see the future of employment?"

"Will the second machine age affect all professions equally?"

"Could a robot do my job better than I?" This is a question that gnaws at many of us as robots and computers inexorably develop the skills to work in ways once considered quintessentially human. Think about self-driving cars, or Amazon's product recommendations, or [Google Translate.](https://translate.google.com/) The real question is not whether these technologies will have employment implications, but rather: how much, and to whom.

Of course, it's worth noting that public alarm about the risk that machines present to jobs has been with us for some time: the Luddite resistance to power looms and similar dates back to the early 19th century. History has repeatedly proven such fears to be unfounded. For example, dramatic technological change led to the percentage of US workers working in agriculture dropping from 40% to less than 2% over the course of the twentieth century, but US unemployment at both the beginning and end of the century was about 5%. 

So, is anything different this time? In short, machines, using advances from machine learning, computer vision and computational linguistics, are increasingly able to perform cognitive tasks. No longer are machines simply substituting for routine physical labour: as automation enters the realm of the mind, many more occupations may come under threat. Furthermore, many of these advances improve our ability to innovate, a feedback loop that is leading to an acceleration of the rate of technological change.

The motivation for replacing humans with machines is not difficult to understand. Digital computation is more scalable than human thinking: computers continue to get cheaper, and you can fit more processors into a room than [humans working with pen and paper.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_computer) Further, machines offer decision-making free of human heuristics and biases: an algorithm won't doze off after lunch unless you explicitly tell it to do so. 

In [our study](http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/publications/view/1314), we set out to answer the questions of which jobs were most vulnerable to technological change. It's clear that the motivations above are already leading to many occupations undergoing automation: Big data analysis is [automating paralegal, contract law and patent law tasks;](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/05/science/05legal.html?pagewanted=all); Orchard Supply Hardware in California is introducing [robotic shopping assistants;](http://online.wsj.com/articles/newest-workers-for-lowes-robots-1414468866) and Kiva Systems was bought by Amazon for [US$775m](http://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304724404577291903244796214) to automate its warehousing. So, if machines can drive, serve customers, and look through data as well as humans, what are humans still good for? 

We identified two human faculties which machines are unlikely to supplant in the near future: creativity and social intelligence. To succeed in either a creative or social task, a worker usually needs to have a deep intuitive understanding of other humans, and such knowledge is difficult for machines to learn. We also identified the ability to interact with complex objects in an unstructured environments as another bottleneck. While we've been hoping for a robotic housemaid for decades, in reality, the challenge of having a robot understand the difference between a pot plant containing dirt and a dirty plate in the messy and changing environment of the average home is likely to keep this a dream for a while longer.



In short,
creatuvity and social intelligence.
Autonomous manipulation is also hard, largely due to the difficulties involved in perception. Nonetheless, some construction, truck-loading and shelf-stacking tasks may be automated.
Unstructured environments are also difficult to automate: warehouses, hospitals and airports are are likely to host automated workers long before the home or office.
We expect social intelligence, creativity and perception and manipulation to be bottlenecks to computerisation.We used a dataset of 702 occupations, for which we have employment, income and occupation features related to automatability (e.g. finger dexterity and persuasion). 
We hand-labelled 70 occupations as being automatable or not according to the literature. Then we predicted the automatability of all occupations.
