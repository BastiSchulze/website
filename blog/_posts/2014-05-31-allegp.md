[Roman Garnett](http://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=CUkAtC4AAAAJ), [Philipp Hennig](http://www.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/nc/employee/details/phennig.html) and I had our [Active Learning of Linear Embeddings for Gaussian Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.6740) paper accepted at [UAI 2014.](http://auai.org/uai2014) The paper makes a couple of contributions, as follows.

1.  An approach to cheaply averaging (marginalising) over the
        hyperparameters of a Gaussian process (GP): the Marginal GP
        (MGP). Roman has released a [MATLAB implementation
        of the MGP,](https://github.com/rmgarnett/mgp) built upon [GPML.](http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code/matlab/doc/index.html)
2.  A practical means of working with GPs even in several
        hundred input dimensions.

Abstract below.

> We propose an active learning method for discovering low- dimensional structure in high-dimensional Gaussian process (GP) tasks. Such problems are increasingly frequent and important, but have hitherto presented severe practical difficulties. We further introduce a novel technique for approximately marginalizing GP hyperparameters, yielding marginal predictions robust to hyperparameter mis-specification. Our method offers an efficient means of performing GP regression, quadrature, or Bayesian optimization in high-dimensional spaces.
